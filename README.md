#  "A review of deep learning methods for semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery" by Dejan Ristovski

Semantic segmentation is one of many important problems in the field of computer
vision. The segmentation of remote sensing images has wide range of applications such
as urban planning and surveillance. With the introduction of deep learning models in
machine learning, models for semantic segmentation problems have seen great
improvements in performance. This research focuses on the fundamental models in deep
learning for semantic segmentations and briefly explains what state of the art models
on this topic look like.
